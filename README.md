# Description

This is the code repository for the applications and examples demonstrated at EuroSTAR 2022 in Copenhagen by (Kristoffer Nordstr√∂m)[https://twitter.com/kristoffer_nord]
All the example were written on Python 3.9 and executed in a \*nix environment, though with care to paths the code is simple enough that it can run in other environments as well.
